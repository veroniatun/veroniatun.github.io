                My project is a shooting platformer game made through Pyarcade, which is a Python module. 
                Python is a programming language similar to the Pyret that I have learned in the previous unit.
                Pyret has Python-inspired syntax for functions, lists, and operators, while Python has slightly more complicated syntex.

                The project is also related to Snap, the first unit that I learned in Computer Science. 
                Snap and Python are very different programming languages. 
                Compared to Snap, Python is a lot more complex, such as switching the sprite costumes which is what I have struggled a lot during my creation of the game.
                It's a lot easier to change the costume of the sprites in Snap as all you need is a block that says "change costume". 
                However, you need to make a function to change specific costumes under certain conditions in Python.

                A main concept that I learned is that nothing is impossible.
                At first, creating a game with a programming language that I've never learned seemed impossible to me.
                But then, when you really start learning, you'll find out that it is kind of interesting, 
                and when you succeed, you will feel a big sence of accomplishment, which is a really valuable and memorable experience.

                I am pretty satisfied of the result of my project. I never thought that I could make such a fun game 
                with different sound effects and sprite actions such as climbing and jumping.
                I've invited my friends and family to play my platformer game, and they've all complimented it.
                There are some more details that I could have included in my game for improvements, 
                such as output a frame that said "You DIED!" when the sprite falls off the ground.
                Although I've struggled a lot and did not make a completely original new game, I was able to follow along the tutorials online to make a game.
                I debugged and modified the game so that it is more playable, appealing and understandable.
                The project mostly met the original goals that I set at the beginning of this project, as I was not able to make a original design.
