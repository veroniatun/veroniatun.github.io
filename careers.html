        <h1>My Career Path</h1>

        <ul>
             
             <li>I developed the skill of self-learning in this project.</li>
            <li>It helps to build independence and the ability to progress without the reliance of a teacher. </li>
             <br>
            <li>The skill of debugging also helps to develop my problem-figuring and problem-solving skills.</li>
            <li>This allows me to find out the main bug of a problem in the future and I can quickly find a resolution to the problem.</li>
             
        </ul> 

             <br>After this project, I am more interested in computer programming than before, and this has now been included in one of my future professions.
             <br>This recently acquired talent opens the door to a job as a programmer. 
             </br>The knowledge gained during the creation of the game, is not necessarily tailored just toward becoming a game producer, but can also be applied to many other areas of computer science.
