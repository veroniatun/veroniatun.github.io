            This game is a platformer game. In order to earn points, the player has to:
            <ul>
               <li>kill enemies</li> 
               <li>collect coins</li> 
               <li>collect green flags</li> 
            </ul> 
            By using the key Q, the player can shoot the enemies, including zombies and robots. The enemies have very high health points, which makes it hard to kill them.
            There are three types of coins, including gold, silver and bronze coins.<br>
            <h3>Values:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Zombie +100</li> 
                <li>Robot +100</li>
                <li>Green flag +25</li> 
                <li>Gold coin +10</li>

                <li>Bronze coin +1</li> 
             </ul> 
             You die and lose if you get into contact with the enemies!
